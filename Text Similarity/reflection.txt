I choose three articles from New York times and three articles from Financial Times as the source of the text. And I choose my wr 100 paper, two articles from Boston Globes, another article from New York times and another article from Financial  Times to compare to the two source text. 
The result of my test is that my wr 100 paper is more likely come from Financial Times and Boston Globe  is more likely to have come from  Financial Times. Part New York Times  is more likely to have come from  New York Times which justifies the effectiveness of my model. Part Financial Times  is more likely to have come from  Financial Times which justifies as well.
I think my text classification program works good. But it can be improved in many different ways. Firstly, we can extend the stem function into more detailed one which include all the prefix and suffix. Then, we can add more attributes. The more attributes we have, the more accurate the result will be. Besides, the algorithm can be improved as well. More optimum algorithm can definitely be found but now I don't know how.
